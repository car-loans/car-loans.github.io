from your computer when you browse this website and request pages from

provide us with personally identifiable information, we will not know 
your name, your email address, or any other personally identifiable

<p><strong>Your Consent</strong></p>

<p>By providing FastAutoFinance32.ca with your personal information, you

Policy and as otherwise permitted by applicable law. You may withdraw 
your consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions

including when you apply for an account or membership, subscribe to a 
newsletter, register to receive information, apply or register for or

<p> (b) Credit Reports</p>

<p>When you apply or register for, order or use certain products or 
services from FastAutoFinance32.ca  (e.g. a referral to a car dealer or 
lender), FastAutoFinance32.ca and/or our partners may obtain your credit
 score and related information from a credit reporting agency to process
 or fulfill the transaction, and FastAutoFinance32.ca  may also use the 
credit score and related information to update your confidential profile

 your request, we will inform you if we have ordered such a report, and 
will give you the name and address of the credit reporting agency that 
furnished the report.</p>

<p>You also acknowledge and agree that any dealers or other persons or 
organizations to which we have disclosed your personal information in 
accordance with this Privacy Policy, may request a credit report for any
 legitimate purpose associated with your application [for credit, 
extending credit, modifying the terms of your credit agreement, or 
collection on your account.]</p>

<p> (c) Information Regarding Referred Transactions</p>

<p>If FastAutoFinance32.ca refers you to an independent business (e.g. a
 car dealer or lender) for a proposed transaction (e.g. a car purchase 
or loan), then FastAutoFinance32.ca may collect from that independent 
business information regarding the transaction to update your 
confidential profile for use by FastAutoFinance32.ca as set out in this 
Privacy Policy.</p>

<p><strong>Disclosure of Information to Third Parties</strong></p>

<p>We may disclose a consumer's personally identifiable information in 
order to effect or carry out any transaction that you have requested of 
us or as necessary to complete our contractual obligations with you. We 
may be compensated for this disclosure by our third-party partners. WE 
RESERVE THE RIGHT TO SELL, RENT OR TRANSFER YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION TO
 THIRD PARTIES FOR ANY PURPOSE IN OUR SOLE DISCRETION. These companies 
may employ the use of an Automated Dialing-Announcing Device (ADAD) to 
make contact with you. We prohibit the sale or transfer of personal 
information to non-affiliated entities for their use without giving you 
the opportunity to opt-out (See Opt-Out below). We may share your 
personally identifiable information with affiliated companies that are 
directly or indirectly controlled by, or under common control of 
FastAutoFinance32.ca. We may send personally identifiable information 
about you to non-affiliated companies that are not directly or 
indirectly controlled by, or under common control of, 
FastAutoFinance32.ca. The personal information collected on this site 
and by third parties will be used to operate the site and to provide the
 services or products or carry out the transactions you have requested 
or authorized. We may change or broaden the use of your personal 
information at any time. We and/or our third-party partners may use your
 personal information to provide promotional offers to you by means of 
email advertising, telephone marketing, use of an Automated 
Dialing-Announcing Device (ADAD), direct mail marketing, banner 
advertising, text messages at the phone number(s) you provide, and other
 possible uses. You can, however, have your name put on our do-not-share
 list by, writing to us at the email address listed below.</p>

<p><strong>Choice/Opt-out</strong></p>

<p>We provide you the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having your personally
 identifiable information used for certain purposes, when we ask for 
this information. For example, if you purchase a product/service but do 
not wish to receive any additional marketing material from us, you can 
indicate your preference on our order form. If you no longer wish to 
receive our newsletter and promotional communications, you may opt-out 
of receiving them by following the instructions included in each 
newsletter or communication or by emailing or calling us per the 
information contained on our contact page. If you do not wish to have 
your personal information collected by any third party that is not our

to actively opt-out of having your personal information shared. Customer
 Service Contact Information:</p>

<p>FastAutoFinance32.ca<br>Email: support@fastautofinance.ca</p>

<p><strong>Service Providers</strong></p>

<p>We may use other third parties to provide certain clerical and 
information processing and shipping services on our site. When you sign 
up for our services, we will share only as much information as is 
necessary for the provision of those services. These third parties are 
prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for any 
other purpose.</p>

<p><strong>Securing the Transmission and Storage of Information</strong></p>

<p>The security of your personal information is extremely important to 
us. We employ generally accepted industry standards to protect the 
personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once 
we receive it. Our site uses SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) security 
technology to encrypt information you provide to us through the site 
when entering sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or 
social security number) on our registration or order forms. This ensures
 that your information is encrypted as it travels over the Internet. SSL
 is an industry-standard protocol for encryption over the internet. 
After information reaches FastAutoFinance32.ca, it is stored on a secure
 server that resides behind firewalls designed to block unauthorized 
access from outside of FastAutoFinance32.ca. You can help to maintain 
the security of your online transactions by not sharing your personal 
information or password with anyone. Remember, no method of transmission
 over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. 
(Example: any information you provide us by email is not encrypted) 
Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to 
protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute 
security. If you have any questions about the security on our Web site, 
please feel free to e-mail us.</p>

<p><strong>Log Files</strong></p>

<p>As is true of most Web sites, we gather certain information 
automatically and store it in log files. This information includes 
internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service 
provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp,
 and click stream data. We use this information, which does not identify
 individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track 
users' movements around the site and to gather demographic information 
about our user base as a whole. We do not link this 
automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information.</p>

<p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>

<p>A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for
 record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on this site. We do not link 
the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable 
information you submit while on our site. We use session ID cookies. We 
use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site. A 
session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. We can at your 
option set a persistent cookie to store your passwords, so you don't 
have to enter it more than once. Persistent cookies also enable us to 
track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on
 our site. If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your 
ability to use some areas of our site, such as contests or surveys, will
 be limited. Some of our business partners (e.g., advertisers) use 
cookies on our site. We have no access to or control over these cookies.
 This privacy statement covers the use of our cookies only and does not 
cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>

<p><strong>Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)</strong></p>

<p>We employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web 
Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by 
informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics 
with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used 
to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, 
which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are 
embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at 
the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by 
clear gifs to our customers' personally identifiable information. We use
 clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have 
been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of 
certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.
 If you would like to opt-out of these emails, please see "Choice and 
Opt-out."</p>
