						<p> (b) Interest-Based Advertising</p>

						<p><strong>Browsing</strong></p>

						<p>This website does not collect personally identifiable information from your computer when you browse this website and request pages from our servers. This means that, unless you voluntarily and knowingly provide us with personally identifiable information, we will not know your name, your email address, or any other personally identifiable information.

						<p><strong>Your Consent</strong></p>

						<p>By providing FastAutoFinance32.ca with your personal information, you consent to the collection, use, disclosure and retention of that information by FastAutoFinance32.ca and our partners (including, but not limited to auto dealers and lenders) in accordance with this Privacy Policy and as otherwise permitted by applicable law. You may withdraw your consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions and on reasonable notice to FastAutoFinance32.ca.</p>

						<p><strong>Information That FastAutoFinance32.ca Collects</strong></p>

						<p> (a) Information You Provide</p>

						<p>You may be asked to voluntarily give your personal information to FastAutoFinance32.ca when you interact with FastAutoFinance32.ca, including when you apply for an account or membership, subscribe to a newsletter, register to receive information, apply or register for or order a product or service offered by a FastAutoFinance32.ca or our partners.</p>

						<p> (b) Credit Reports</p>

						<p> (c) Information Regarding Referred Transactions</p>

						<p>If FastAutoFinance32.ca refers you to an independent business (e.g. a car dealer or lender) for a proposed transaction (e.g. a car purchase or loan), then FastAutoFinance32.ca may collect from that independent business information regarding the transaction to update your confidential profile for use by FastAutoFinance32.ca as set out in this Privacy Policy.</p>

						<p><strong>Disclosure of Information to Third Parties</strong></p>

						<p>We may disclose a consumer's personally identifiable information in order to effect or carry out any transaction that you have requested of us or as necessary to complete our contractual obligations with you. We may be compensated for this disclosure by our third-party partners. WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO SELL, RENT OR TRANSFER YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES FOR ANY PURPOSE IN OUR SOLE DISCRETION. These companies may employ the use of an Automated Dialing-Announcing Device (ADAD) to make contact with you. We prohibit the sale or transfer of personal information to non-affiliated entities for their use without giving you the opportunity to opt-out (See Opt-Out below). We may share your personally identifiable information with affiliated companies that are directly or indirectly controlled by, or under common control of FastAutoFinance32.ca. We may send personally identifiable information about you to non-affiliated companies that are not directly or indirectly controlled by, or under common control of, FastAutoFinance32.ca. The personal information collected on this site and by third parties will be used to operate the site and to provide the services or products or carry out the transactions you have requested or authorized. We may change or broaden the use of your personal information at any time. We and/or our third-party partners may use your personal information to provide promotional offers to you by means of email advertising, telephone marketing, use of an Automated Dialing-Announcing Device (ADAD), direct mail marketing, banner advertising, text messages at the phone number(s) you provide, and other possible uses. You can, however, have your name put on our do-not-share list by, writing to us at the email address listed below.</p>

						<p><strong>Choice/Opt-out</strong></p>

						<p>We provide you the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having your personally identifiable information used for certain purposes, when we ask for this information. For example, if you purchase a product/service but do not wish to receive any additional marketing material from us, you can indicate your preference on our order form. If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each newsletter or communication or by emailing or calling us per the information contained on our contact page. If you do not wish to have your personal information collected by any third party that is not our agent/service provider, please contact our customer service department to actively opt-out of having your personal information shared. Customer Service Contact Information:</p>

						<p>FastAutoFinance32.ca<br>Email: support@fastautofinance.club</p>

						<p><strong>Service Providers</strong></p>

						<p>We may use other third parties to provide certain clerical and information processing and shipping services on our site. When you sign up for our services, we will share only as much information as is necessary for the provision of those services. These third parties are prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for any other purpose.</p>

						<p><strong>Securing the Transmission and Storage of Information</strong></p>

						<p>The security of your personal information is extremely important to us. We employ generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. Our site uses SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) security technology to encrypt information you provide to us through the site when entering sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number) on our registration or order forms. This ensures that your information is encrypted as it travels over the Internet. SSL is an industry-standard protocol for encryption over the internet. After information reaches FastAutoFinance32.ca, it is stored on a secure server that resides behind firewalls designed to block unauthorized access from outside of FastAutoFinance32.ca. You can help to maintain the security of your online transactions by not sharing your personal information or password with anyone. Remember, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. (Example: any information you provide us by email is not encrypted) Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about the security on our Web site, please feel free to e-mail us.</p>

						<p><strong>Log Files</strong></p>

						<p>As is true of most Web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and click stream data. We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users' movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We do not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information.</p>

						<p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>

						<p>A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on this site. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site. We use session ID cookies. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. We can at your option set a persistent cookie to store your passwords, so you don't have to enter it more than once. Persistent cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site. If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some areas of our site, such as contests or surveys, will be limited. Some of our business partners (e.g., advertisers) use cookies on our site. We have no access to or control over these cookies. This privacy statement covers the use of our cookies only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>

						<p><strong>Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)</strong></p>

						<p>We employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers' personally identifiable information. We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. If you would like to opt-out of these emails, please see "Choice and Opt-out."</p>

						<p><strong>Links to Other Sites</strong></p>

						<p>This Web site may contain links to other sites such as our affiliates as well as third parties which are not owned or controlled by us. Please be aware that this privacy policy only addresses our company's use and disclosure of your information collected on this site. While we try to link only to sites that share our standards and respect for privacy, we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and to read the applicable privacy policies and terms of conditions of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies only to information collected by this Web site.</p>

						<p><strong>Co-branded sites</strong></p>

						<p>We may be co-branded with "partners and affiliates". These business to business relationships are helpful to us and to you as they afford all concerned with greater product and service opportunities. We always provide opt-out opportunities regarding the sharing of your information with such partners and affiliates. Please note the sites linked to our site are governed by their own privacy policies which may or may not reach the standards set by our company.</p>

						<p><strong>Customer Service</strong></p>

						<p>If you send us correspondence, including e-mails and faxes, we may retain such information in your customer file. Information you give us over the telephone may be noted for your file. We may also keep copies of any correspondence sent to you. We retain these records in order to provide the products and services you have requested and to measure and improve our customer service. We may, over time, delete these records as permitted by law. Phone calls may be recorded or monitored for customer satisfaction purposes. Based upon the personally identifiable information you provide, we may communicate with you to provide the services you request, and to manage your account. We may communicate via email or telephone, in accordance with your wishes.</p>

						<p><strong>Legal Disclaimer</strong></p>
